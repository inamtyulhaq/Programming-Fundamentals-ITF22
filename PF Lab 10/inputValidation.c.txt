//this loop is simply discarding the values stored in the input buffer when user entered non-integer value
//otherwise the next time the we use scanf, it will read from the previously stored values in input buffer instead of taking user input
//will result in infinite loop if you remove this line, try it!
//getchar() reads a character from the input buffer and removes it
//hence through this loop we are emptying the input buffer until we find that '\n' or the enter that the user pressed
